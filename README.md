- a project tester
- a src finder
- a proto finder

## fast gitmoji finder :
simply enter

## the projtester :
you simply have to writer some tests on a file and run the test.sh 
it will execute a given binary and compare the output with the expected output and 
compare the return code with the expected one
<br>
<br>

## the src finder : 
it will find every .c file and they'r path used for Makefile so you don't have to do illegal 
things like : src/*.c
<br>
<br>

## the proto finder :
is used for c and c++ in h and hpp respectively 
it is used to remove the implicit declaration by going throught each file in every folder and subfolder
find every function and write in the console the proto of the function so you only have to copy paste it 
in your .h or .hpp file
